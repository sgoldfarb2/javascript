 //everything that happens in the browser is registered as an event: moving your mouse, clicking a button, anything!
//we can write custom code that tells our browser how to respond to events
//we are currently handling events in passive form, where they script runs as soon as the document is loaded
//now we are going to use events to add a layer to our JS, that triggers functions and behaviors when specific interactions occer

//the process
//identify the DOM node the behavior will be attached to
    //call to action button
//identify the event you want to detect and bind to a DOM node
    //button click, mouse movement, hover over a region of the page
//create a function that is triggered when the event fires

//there are 3 ways to handle events
//tag attributes - not really used anymore except with react
//dot notation
//addEventListener() --> this is what we are going to use, and is the most popular one because you can select a group and then get an event object and figure out which one you want to run it on
